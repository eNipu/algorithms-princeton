# Coursera - Introduction to Algorithms (Princeton University)

This repo holds my solutions to the programming assignments for the [Coursera class - Introduction to Algorithms (Princeton University)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-algorithms/home/welcome).

I tried to follow the TDD (Test Driven Development) workflow during this 
course when applicable, so there exist unittests demonstrating the 
functionality of the classes that were developed. I follow the [Roy Osherove convention](http://osherove.com/blog/2005/4/3/naming-standards-for-unit-tests.html) for the naming of my 
unittests.

* [Programming Assignment 1 - Percolation](assignment1-percolation)
* [Programming Assignment 2 - Deques and Randomized Queues](assignment2-deques_and_randomized_queues)
* [Programming Assignment 3 - Collinear Points](assignment3-collinear_points)
