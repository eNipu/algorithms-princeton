# Coursera - Introduction to Algorithms (Princeton University)

This repo holds my solutions to the programming assignments for the [Coursera class - Introduction to Algorithms (Princeton University)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-algorithms/home/welcome).

I tried to follow the TDD (Test Driven Development) workflow during this course when applicable, so there exist unittests demonstrating the functionality of the classes that were developed.
