# Programming Assignment 2 - Deques and Randomized Queues
                             

This first assignment's specification can be found [here](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html).

Briefly, in this assignment we need to implement a deque (Double-Ended Queue
or Deque) - that is a generalization of stack and queue that supports adding
or removing either from the front or from the back.
  
The second part of this assignment is to implement a randomized queue (the 
item removed is random)

### Challenges
* Decide and implement the data structure that is more appropriate for each 
task (linked list or resizing array).
* Implement randomization effectively.

Deliverables:

* [Deque.java](src/Deque.java)
* [RandomizedQueue.java](src/RandomizedQueue.java)
* [Subset.java](src/Subset.java)

Unittests:

* [DequeTest.java](test/DequeTest.java)
* [RandomizedQueueTest.java](test/RandomizedQueueTest.java)
