# Programming Assignment 5 - Kd-Trees
                             

The fifth assignment's specification can be found [here](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree.html).

In this assignment are asked to implement kd-trees (2-d in our case), an efficient data structure for representing and asking queries on points in the unit square. 


Deliverables:

* [PointSET.java](src/PointSET.java)
* [KdTree.java](src/KdTree.java)

Unittests:

* [PointSETTest.java](test/PointSETTest.java)
* [KdTreeTest.java](test/KdTreeTest.java)
